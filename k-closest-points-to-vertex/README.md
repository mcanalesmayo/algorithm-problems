# K closest points to a vertex

Find the `K` closest points to a vertex, given a list of `N` points.

If there are `N` points which have same distance to the vertex and `K` is less than `N` then return only `K` points (can be chosen randomly).

Current solution:
* Time complexity: `O(N*logK)`
* Space complexity: `O(logK)`
